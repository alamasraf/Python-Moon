git add . <all files>,
git commit -m "<write your message>" 
git push origin <banch-name>
e.g. git push origin main 


#say, collaborator has made changes, then your routine steps should be:
1. :git fetch origin (from your terminal while you're in root folder) or Use a tool like git pull to fetch and merge in one step: 

:git pull origin main 

2. Merge the changes: 

:git merge origin/main  // Replace 'main' with your main branch name

3. Resolve Conflicts (if any):

If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually. You'll need to edit the conflicting files and resolve the merge conflicts.
Use a merge tool or a text editor to compare the changes and decide which changes to keep.
Once you've resolved the conflicts, stage the changes: 

: git add . # dot adds all files 

means, change manually, add or delete or re code by yourself 

4. commit the  merged chnages 

: git commit -m "added my changes"

5. push the changes: 

:git push origin main

#done
